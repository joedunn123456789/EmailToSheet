## Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the Automate tab in Excel"
- Make sure you're using Excel **for the web** (not desktop Excel)
- Check that you have a Microsoft 365 subscription
- Try a different browser (Chrome or Edge work best)

### "I can't find my script in Power Automate"
- Make sure you saved the script in Excel
- Try refreshing the Power Automate page
- Make sure you're selecting the correct Excel file

### "The flow ran but no emails appeared"
- Check the flow's run history for errors
- Make sure you're looking at the correct Excel file
- Try running the flow again
- Check that the folder name matches exactly

### "Error: Script timed out"
- This can happen with very large emails
- Try limiting the body preview to fewer characters in the script
- Reduce the number of emails you're processing at once

### "I keep getting duplicate emails"
- The automatic flow adds emails as they arrive
- Don't also run the manual flow on the same emails
- Consider clearing your Excel file before running the manual flow

## Explain It Like You're 5 üë∂

Remember the two-robot system? Here's how it works with Office Scripts:

**Robot #1 - The Mail Carrier (Power Automate):**
- Watches your Outlook mailbox üëÄ
- When a new email arrives in "Job Hunting", it picks it up üì¨
- Reads all the important info (who sent it, what it says, when it arrived)
- Carries that info to Robot #2

**Robot #2 - The Filing Robot (Office Script in Excel):**
- Lives inside your Excel file üìä
- Waits for Robot #1 to bring email info
- When info arrives, it writes it down in a new row
- Keeps everything neat and organized

**The Cool Part:**
Robot #1 knows how to talk to Robot #2! When you set up Power Automate, you're basically teaching Robot #1 to say:

"Hey Robot #2, I have an email!"
- "The date is: [date]"
- "It's from: [person]"
- "The subject is: [subject]"
- "Here's what it says: [body]"
- "It was in the: [folder] folder"

And Robot #2 says "Got it! Writing it down!" and adds a new row to Excel.

**Two Modes:**
1. **Guard Mode** - Robot #1 stands guard and catches EVERY new email as it arrives
2. **Collection Mode** - You press a button and Robot #1 goes and grabs ALL the old emails at once

You get to choose which mode(s) you want! üéÆ
