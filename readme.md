## üôã FAQ

**Q: Can I export emails with attachments?**
A: Currently, only email metadata and body text are exported. Attachment support could be added as a future feature.

**Q: How many emails can I export at once?**
A: Gmail script: Limited by execution time (typically 1000-2000 emails). Outlook script: No hard limit, but processing 1000+ emails may take several minutes.

**Q: Can I schedule these to run automatically?**
A: 
- Gmail: Use Google Apps Script triggers (time-driven)
- Outlook: Use Task Scheduler (Windows) or cron (Mac/Linux)

**Q: Does this work with other email providers?**
A: The Outlook/Python script works with any email provider that supports IMAP (Gmail, Yahoo, etc.). Just change the IMAP server address.

**Q: Will this delete my emails?**
A: No! Both scripts are read-only. They only read and export emails.
