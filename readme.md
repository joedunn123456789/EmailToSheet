# Email to Excel Exporters

A collection of scripts to export emails from Gmail and Outlook to Excel/Google Sheets for easy organization and analysis.

## üìã Overview

This repository contains two main solutions:

1. **Gmail to Google Sheets** - Google Apps Script that transfers Gmail emails to a Google Sheet
2. **Outlook to Excel** - Python script that exports Outlook emails to an Excel file using OAuth2

Perfect for organizing job applications, tracking correspondence, archiving emails, or any situation where you need your emails in a spreadsheet format!

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Update (2024):** Microsoft has disabled Basic Authentication (app passwords + IMAP) for most personal Outlook accounts. This repository uses OAuth2 Modern Authentication ([outlook_to_excel.py](outlook_to_excel.py)) that works with current Microsoft security requirements. See [OAUTH_SETUP_PERSONAL.md](OAUTH_SETUP_PERSONAL.md) for setup instructions.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Gmail Issues

**"Script requires authorization"**
- This is normal on first run
- Click "Review Permissions" ‚Üí Choose your account ‚Üí Allow

**"No emails found"**
- Check your label name (use hyphens for spaces: `job-hunting` not `Job Hunting`)
- Try `"in:inbox"` to test with all inbox emails
- Make sure you have emails in that label

### Outlook OAuth2 Issues

**"Work or school account only" error**
- Make sure you selected "Personal Microsoft accounts only" when registering your Azure app
- Check that TENANT_ID is set to "consumers" in your .env file

**"Invalid client" error**
- Double-check your CLIENT_ID in the .env file
- Make sure you copied the entire Application (client) ID from Azure

**"Permission denied" or "Consent required"**
- Make sure you added Mail.Read permission in Azure Portal
- Try revoking and re-granting consent

**"Module not found" errors**
- Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Or manually: `pip install openpyxl msal requests python-dotenv`

**Authentication keeps asking for login**
- The token cache may be corrupted
- Look for hidden cache files and delete them


---

## üéØ Use Cases

- **Job Hunting**: Track applications, responses, and interviews
- **Email Archiving**: Keep a backup of important emails
- **Email Analysis**: Analyze email patterns, response times, senders
- **Data Migration**: Move emails between services

## üîí Security & Privacy

### Gmail Script

- No data sent to external services (besides Microsoft for authentication)
- Read-only access (won't modify or delete emails)
- Your Azure app is private to you only
- Authentication tokens cached locally for convenience

**Important:**
- Never share your CLIENT_ID publicly (keep .env file private)
- Never commit .env files to GitHub (already in .gitignore)
- Your Azure app registration is free and only accessible by you
- You can revoke access anytime from your Microsoft account settings

## üôã FAQ

**Q: Can I export emails with attachments?**
A: Currently, only email metadata and body text are exported. Attachment support could be added as a future feature.

**Q: How many emails can I export at once?**
A: Gmail script: Limited by execution time (typically 1000-2000 emails). Outlook script: No hard limit, but processing 1000+ emails may take several minutes.

**Q: Can I schedule these to run automatically?**
A: 
- Gmail: Use Google Apps Script triggers (time-driven)
- Outlook: Use Task Scheduler (Windows) or cron (Mac/Linux)

**Q: Does this work with other email providers?**
A: The Gmail script works with Gmail. The Outlook OAuth2 script works with personal Microsoft accounts (@outlook.com, @hotmail.com, @live.com). The legacy IMAP script may work with other providers, but Microsoft has deprecated this method.

**Q: Will this delete my emails?**
A: No! Both scripts are read-only. They only read and export emails.
